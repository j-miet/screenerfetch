-----Setting up tests for new project-----
-had some difficulties getting pytest recognizing module imports, but this helped:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/50610630

TL;DR: 
-create pyproject.toml file to root
-add source folder 'screenerfetch' and test folder 'tests' to pythonpath -> remember to insert square brackets [] for 
 multiple paths.
 >'tests' is only added to access tests/helpers; if helpers wasn't needed, 'screenerfetch' alone would suffice.

-----For user-----

To run you need:
-install pytest and pytest-mock, with pip:  
    pip install pytest pytest-mock     


How to use in VS Code: 
-put all tests under root folder e.g. screenerfetch/tests/
 >if unit test, place inside 'unit' folder
 >if integration test, place inside 'integration' folder
-search '>Python: Configure tests' in search bar and select pytest + set test folder as 'tests'

# Running all tests #
-to run tests, change directory to project root (if it wasn't already) and type
    pytest 
 then press enter. 

# Running only specific tests # 
-it might be better to run tests in batches: first unit tests, then integration tests.
 >same as before, cd into project root.
 >to run unit tests, type
    pytest tests/unit
 >to run integration tests, type
    pytest tests/integration
---and if you'd still like to only run a specific test file, say an unit test, type
    pytest tests/unit/test_file_name.py
